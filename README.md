This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Unfinished Project for KnightHacks

App for budgeting on Steam 

## Problems

Couldn't get React to render table rows using Array.map
IDK what's wrong, I have tried too many ways and I need sleep

Also using a heroku app as a proxy for CORS

## Future
Not going to submit this project, but will continue to work on it, so I can learn more about React

okay I'm going to sleep 
maybe I should stop going solo on virtual hackathons
